READ THIS FOR INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

## NPM I

'npm i' will install all dependencies, but you'll need to install Expo on your machine.

## Expo

Run the command 'npm install --global expo-cli' to install Expo. You'll also need to download Expo Go on your phone. Once installed, cd into the project folder and run 'expo start'. This will generate a QR code for the Expo Go app to scan and it will load on your phone.

PHONE MUST BE ON THE SAME NETWORK AS YOUR MACHINE.

Press r in the terminal to hot reload the app to see changes quickly.

## Test

Once you've followed these instructions you should see "hello I am an app" when you start the app, or whatever it's changed to later on.
